              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p class="intro">I am student at D.Y.Patil College of Engineering, Pune.
                    Pursuing my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering.
                    I have good knowledge about C,C++ programming languages.Currently I am
                    focusing on DSA and Problem Solving skills. I am also a good Web Developer.</p>

                <h3>Data Structure & Algorithm</h3>
                <p class="dsa-description">As a beginner in data structures and algorithms, I have a strong foundation in programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional statements.I have a basic understanding of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, and how to perform operations on them, such as insertions, deletions, and searching.
                  I am familiar with basic algorithms, such as sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quick sort) and searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search), and have a basic understanding of time and space complexity analysis.I have also been exposed to some fundamental algorithms such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms,and graph algorithms.
                  With practice and further study,I will be able to solve more complex problems, implement more advanced algorithms, and analyze their time and space complexities more effectively. My goal is to continually improve ,my skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures, eventually becoming an expert in the field.

                <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
                <p class="web-description">As a beginner web developer,I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have worked with basic web development tools such as text editors and browser dev tools.I have a solid foundation in creating responsive and dynamic websites and have experience with CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.
                  I have a basic understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and have used JavaScript to manipulate elements on a page.I have also worked with basic JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.I am familiar with the basics of web architecture and have experience with creating simple server-side scripts using technologies such as PHP or Node.js.
                  With practice and further study, I will be able to create more complex web applications, work with databases, and implement more advanced front-end and back-end technologies. My goal is to continually improve skills and deepen understanding of web development, eventually becoming an expert in the field.</p>
